# Donor - Donee
This project is aimed at developing a web application that depicts the contribution of basic needs to underprivileged people. The website consists of a portal of donor, donee and the helper. The donor can donate the necessities such as food, cloth, books and other miscellaneous things. The donation can be received from any College mess or canteen, marriage party, NGOs, hotels and any common institution. The donor can donate things by logging in the portal and then by sharing their information such address, the donation and timing to receive a donation from the donor. The donee is the poverty-stricken people who are deprived of such basic needs. Donee portal will be logged in by NGOs and other organization working for the welfare of the people, who can receive food from the mentioned address and donate it to the needy people. The Helper portal is for any helping hand like us, who want to come up and make a contribution to the poor people and slum. They will basically connect the donor and the done in making contribution.  We will be adding a badge to the respective donorâ€™s portal as they will be contributing needy people.
